# 6502

> A 6502 emulator in C.

## Motivation 

The [MOS 6502](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502) was present in many of the computational devices I interacted with during my formative years: the BBC Micros at my school, the Nintendo Entertainment System I was lucky enough to have at home, and even the tamagotchis that beeped below school desks just out of sight (but invariably not out of earshot) of our teachers.

In deference to its important role in the technological progression of computers, I want an understanding of how the 6502 ticks--building this emulator is my modest monument to an important part of computational history.
